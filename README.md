# Smorgas-Chord
This application will allow the user to search lyrics and guitar tabs for popular songs using two different API. The lyrics will appear on the page while the guitar tabs will open into a Songsterr page. The previously searched songs will appear in the history, and clicking on the history will pull up the previous search. There is also a peripheral API that will call randomized Kanye West quotes.
